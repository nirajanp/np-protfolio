# My Protfolio

This is a simple implementation of a protfolio project. I have used HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript to complete this project. All the features are tested in Google Chrome and Firefox. The website is hosted in netlify. I have used gulp to compile scss file into css and and to enable browser sync capability.
