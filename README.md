# My Protfolio

This is a simple implementation of a portfolio project. I have used HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript to complete this project. All the features are tested in Google Chrome and Firefox. The website is hosted in netlify. I have used gulp to compile scss file into css and and to enable browser sync capability. 

Live version of this protfolio can be accessed at https://nirajan.netlify.app/.
